## Description
My motivation for this project was to attempt the best that I could through working from HTML to CSS. I built this project to demonstrate the code I have learned in a working example. I started by making my html files and looking at the example images of what base was needed without any styling. After I created all 3 HTML files I then started on my CSS by adding the required elements/class/style/etx. For the issues I ran into I tried to use Google-fu and off the W3 website to see examples of what I was trying to do. I made my project stand out by implementing both a sticky navigator and footer as well as including a table of contents.
